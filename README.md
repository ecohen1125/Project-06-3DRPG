# Project-06

## Implementation / Features you added

I made the world of a street with assets I found online.

I added in a player that has the Joe skin from Maximo.com.

The camera follows the player and the player can control the camera with their mouse.

I got the Boss skin from Maximo that is the enemy/AI Agent.

I got an asset from the Unity store that I added dialog to that tells you where to go and what to do.

I added a key that you must pick up that triggers the agents to flood the street.

The AI agents spawn on a building and jump off. Then they will target the bench and go in random directions afterwards.

The player's goal is to kill as many agents as possible with the gun in their hand.

The score in the top right of the screen will show how many they have killed.

When the player shoots, the player will animate to reflect that they are shooting.
