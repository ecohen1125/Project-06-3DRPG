 -> firstResponse

== firstResponse ==
    * Where is it? 
        It is just down the road, but be careful. Once you pick it up, the gang will send people to kill you.
        -> second
        
== second ==
    * What do I do about it?
        You are going to have to kill as many of them as you can.
